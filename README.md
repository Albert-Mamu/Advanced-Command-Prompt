## ARCHITECTURAL OVERVIEW
This is a hyper-advanced hybrid command processor with enterprise-grade capabilities. The code represents a modular, extensible framework combining system administration, cryptographic operations, network diagnostics, and hardware intelligence.


## CORE COMPONENTS BREAKDOWN

#### UNIVERSAL COMMAND PARSER SYSTEM
- WindowsPathParser: Advanced Windows path normalization with UNC support
- UniversalCommandParser: Cross-platform command parsing with quoted string handling
- Intelligent path resolution with drive letter detection and absolute/relative path conversion

#### INTERNET SPEED TESTING ENGINE
- Multi-server fallback system with global test endpoints
- Comprehensive metrics: Download/upload speeds, latency, packet loss, jitter
- Connection quality assessment with DNS verification and IP detection
- Real-time progress visualization during speed tests
- Intelligent server selection based on latency metrics

#### CRYPTOGRAPHIC HASH SYSTEM
- 12+ hash algorithms including SHA-256, SHA-512, SHA3, BLAKE2
- Dual-hash computation (SHA1+MD5) for legacy verification
- Performance benchmarking with speed comparisons
- File integrity verification with hash matching
- Progress tracking for large files

#### UNIT CONVERSION FRAMEWORK
- 11 measurement categories: Length, area, volume, mass, time, temperature, speed, pressure, energy, data storage, angles
- Intelligent category detection between units
- Batch conversion to multiple units simultaneously
- Temperature scale conversion with special handling

#### DEVICE INTELLIGENCE CORE
- Hardware fingerprinting with CPU, GPU, memory, storage analysis
- Real-time sensor monitoring: temperatures, fan speeds, voltages
- Performance metrics collection and visualization
- Cross-platform hardware detection (Windows/Linux/macOS)

#### ADVANCED STORAGE OPERATIONS
- Real disk scanning with file system analysis
- Low-level formatting with multiple wipe patterns (zero, random, secure)
- Secure erase methods from quick to military-grade
- Disk cloning with progress tracking
- File system repair and defragmentation analysis

#### NETWORK OPERATIONS SUITE
- Enhanced WHOIS with multiple query methods (system command, TCP, HTTP APIs)
- Traceroute with real-time output
- HTTP client supporting multiple methods
- File downloading with progress bars
